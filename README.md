# Grokking_Deep_learning_Book_Notes #
These are my notes from the book by Andrew Task called 'Grokking Deep Learning' by Manning Publications (https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning).<br>
Disclaimer: The images found in these Jupyter notebooks are screenshots taken from the book in order to aid my understanding when later going through the notes. Also, although I have tried to write the notes in my own words, at times that I felt that the author's syntax was clearer, I copied the words directly from the book.<br>  
These are not intended for any other use other than my own personal study.

## Dependencies ##
Python 3.5^ needs to be installed the system.
The notes use iPython (Jupyter notebooks) as this enables the combination of code and mark-up language in the same environment which I believe
greatly helps in understanding. 
Jupyter can be downloaded from here http://jupyter.org/
Or through anaconda:
`conda install jupyter notebook`

The only other dependency is the numpy library which again can be installed using the conda or pip commands.
