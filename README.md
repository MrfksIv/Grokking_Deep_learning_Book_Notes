# Grokking_Deep_learning_Book_Notes #
These are my notes from the book by Andrew Task 'Grokking Deep Learning' by Manning Publications (https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning).
Disclaimer: The images found in these Jupyter notebooks are screenshots taken from the book in order to aid my understanding when later going through the notes. 
These are not intended for any other use other than my own personal study.

## Dependencies ##
Python 3.5^ needs to be installed the system.
The notes use iPython (Jupyter notebooks) as this enables the combination of code and mark-up language in the same environment which I believe
greatly helps in understanding. 
Jupyter can be downloaded from here http://jupyter.org/
Or through anaconda:
`conda install jupyter notebook`

The only other dependency is the numpy library which again can be installed using the conda or pip commands.
