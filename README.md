# Grokking_Deep_learning_Book_Notes #
These are my notes from the book by Andrew Task called 'Grokking Deep Learning' by Manning Publications (https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning).<br>
Disclaimer: The images found in these Jupyter notebooks are screenshots taken from the book in order to aid my understanding when later going through the notes. <br> Also, although I have tried to write the notes in my own words, at times that I felt that the author's syntax was clearer and more concise than anything I could have written. In such cases I copied the words directly from the book.<br>  
__Finally, these notes ARE NOT a replacement to the actual book, not by a long shot. They are just a brief summary of the content, at best. It is a great book for understanding how NNs work and I strongly reccomend buying it, if you want to understand how neural nets work from first principles but without mathematical rigorousness.__
These are not intended for any other use other than my own personal study.

## Dependencies ##
Python 3.5^ needs to be installed on the system.
The notes use iPython (Jupyter notebooks) as this enables the combination of code and mark-up language in the same environment which I believe greatly aids in understanding.<br>
Jupyter can be downloaded here: <br>http://jupyter.org/
Or through anaconda:<br>
`conda install jupyter notebook`<br>
Or possibly pip and virtualenv if you are into that kind of thing.<br>
The only other dependency is the numpy library which again can be installed using the conda or pip commands:<br>
`pip install numpy`<br>
`conda install numpy`
